# Architecture for the ProxiMate Bot

The ProxiMate Bot is designed to act as a proxy for a user on both
Twitter and Discord when they are not available.

The bot's primary function is to respond to messages and questions
directed at the user, allowing them to maintain a presence on both
platforms even when they are not actively using them.

## Overview

The ProxiMate Bot is built using the following technologies:

- Twitter API
- Discord API
- Python programming language - nltk / TextBlob library for natural language processing

The bot is hosted on a cloud server and runs continuously, monitoring
for new messages on both Twitter and Discord. When a message is received,
the bot uses natural language processing to determine the user's intent
and respond appropriately.

## High-Level Design

The ProxiMate Bot's architecture can be broken down into the following
components:

- Twitter and Discord API Integration: The bot integrates with both the
  Twitter and Discord APIs to receive and send messages on each platform.

- Natural Language Processing: The bot uses the TextBlob library to
  perform natural language processing on incoming messages to determine
  user intent and generate appropriate responses.

- Message Routing: Once the user's intent has been determined, the bot
  routes the message to the appropriate response handler.

- Response Handlers: These handlers generate responses to the user's
  message based on their intent. For example, if the user is asking
  a question, the bot will use a Q&A response handler to generate an
  appropriate response.

## Deployment

The ProxiMate Bot is deployed on a cloud server using a Docker
container. The Docker container includes all necessary dependencies,
including Python and the required libraries.

To deploy the bot, the following steps are taken:

- Install Docker on the server
- Build the Docker container using the provided Dockerfile
- Start the container, which will automatically start the ProxiMate Bot

## Conclusion

The ProxiMate Bot is a useful tool for users who want to maintain a
presence on both Twitter and Discord even when they are not available. Its
architecture is designed to be scalable and easy to maintain, making it
a useful tool for individuals and organizations alike.
