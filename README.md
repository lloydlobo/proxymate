# ProxiMate Bot

## Mission Statement

The ProxyMate Bot aims to help individuals maintain meaningful
conversations with their friends, even when they are not available,
by acting as their personal proxy.

## Description

The ProxyMate Bot is a Twitter and Discord bot that acts as a mirror for
individuals who want to learn more about themselves and improve their
social interactions. It allows individuals to maintain conversations
with their friends, even when they are busy, by providing a personal
proxy to represent them.

## Usage

To use the ProxyMate Bot, individuals can simply invite the bot to their
Twitter or Discord server, and then set up their personal preferences and
conversation topics. Whenever they are not available to talk, the bot will
act as their proxy and engage in conversations on their behalf. The bot
will also provide insights and feedback to help individuals understand
their communication style and improve their social skills.

  has on behalf of an individual, so they can review them later and learn
  from them.

  and conversation topics, so the bot can engage in conversations that align
  with their interests.
- Insight and Feedback: The bot will provide feedback and insights to help
  individuals understand their communication style and improve their social skills.
- Privacy and Security: The ProxyMate Bot will ensure that all conversations and
  personal information are kept secure and private, and will only engage in
  conversations with individuals who have explicitly granted it permission.

## Additional Features

- Smart Response: The bot can learn from the individual's past
  conversations and use that knowledge to provide more accurate and
  personalized responses.
- Personality Matching: The bot can match individuals with similar personalities,
  so they can engage in more meaningful conversations.

  This represents the idea of the bot reflecting the user's personality back to them.

  a person's profile.
- The text "ProxyMate Bot" can be written in bold and clean font, either below
  or next to the logo.

### Other design elements

    The interface of the app can have a simple and clean design with intuitive navigation.
    The chat window can have a friendly and conversational tone, with the bot's responses being clear and easy to understand.
